    <h2>Hoisting</h2>
    <p>
      The process of hoisting happens in each execution context (area where the code is executed on
      the Call Stack)

    <!-- Prototypal Inheritance in JavaScript | A unique and interesting topic when learned standalone while not thinking about JavaScript classes! -->

    <h2>Prototypal Inheritance in JavaScript</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Definition-1:</strong>
      Prototypal Inheritance is a feature in JavaScript which allows an object to inherit properties
      and methods from another object (usually known as the object's prototype)
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Definition-2:</strong>
     <p>JavaScript inheritance modal is based on prototypes: Objects inherit directly from other objects, instead of classes, through prototype links</p>
    </p>

    The story of Talut(known as Saul in the Bible) in the Quran, found in Surah Al - Baqarah(2: 246 - 251), provides profound insights into human nature and the concept of reliability.When the Israelites were oppressed and sought a leader, they asked their prophet for a king to lead them in battle.God appointed Talut, a man of humble means but chosen for his wisdom and physical strength, as their king.However, many among them questioned Talutâ€™s selection, doubting his qualifications because he lacked wealth and status.
