// What is prototypal inheritance in JavaScript?
// Prototypal inheritance is a feature in JavaScript where an object can inherit properties and methods from another object without the need to create classes. In JavaScript each and every object has a hidden link (called [[Prototype]]) to another object, known as object's prototype.
